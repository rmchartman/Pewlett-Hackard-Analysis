# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview 
### Background 
Pewlett Hackard is a large company with thousands of employees who have been with the company for many years. In the next few years, there will be a “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. In order to better prepare the company for the retirement and hiring of replacements for the employees retiring, some analysis must be done.
### Purpose
1. Determine the number of retiring employees per title.
2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results: 
-There are 90,398 employees at Pewlett Hackard who will be reaching retirement age in the coming years, 41,380 of which current employees.
-The top retiring titles of all retirement age employees in order of popularity are pictured below:

-There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. 
-The titles for those who are eligible for the mentorship program are pictured below:

## Summary: 
Since there are 41,380 current employees who are eligible for upcoming retirement, 41,380 roles will need to be filled. Looking at the roles of the current employees who are eligible for the mentorship program, there are similar roles to what roles will need to be filled, but there are not enough mentors available and not all of the roles are covered. In addition to the expected analysis, a new view was provided to list the number of mentors available in each role to be able to prepare the mentoring program for the roles that will be retiring. However, another view that may be helpful would be to look at the progression of roles (e.g. Engineer to Senior Engineer) to look at how many employees are in roles in which they could be promoted, and then refigure the numbers of new roles to look for more entry level roles for incoming employees from outside the company.
